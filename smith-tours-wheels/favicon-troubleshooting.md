# Fixing Favicon Issues

If your website is still showing a heart icon or the wrong favicon, follow these troubleshooting steps:

## Common Reasons for Favicon Issues

1. **Browser Caching**: Browsers aggressively cache favicons, often ignoring changes
2. **Incorrect File Formats**: Some placeholder files may not be in the right format for all browsers
3. **Conflicting Favicon References**: Other references might be taking precedence
4. **Path Issues**: File paths might not be correct in your development environment

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Test with the Favicon Test Page

1. Run your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or 
   yarn dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the favicon test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/favicon-test.html
   ```

3. Check if the favicon shows correctly on this test page

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

Browser caching is the most common reason for favicon issues. Try:

- Hard reload the page: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache in settings
- Try an incognito/private browsing window
- Try a different browser

### Step 3: Generate Proper Favicon Files

Our current solution includes:

1. Added version query parameters (`?v=2`) to favicon links to bust cache
2. Added an inline SVG favicon as a fallback
3. Created SVG-based placeholder files

For a definitive solution, generate proper binary favicon files:

1. Go to [favicon.io/favicon-converter/](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
2. Upload your `src/assets/Smith-logo.png` file
3. Download the generated package
4. Replace all the files in your `public` directory

### Step 4: Check for Conflicting References

If issues persist:

1. Search your codebase for other favicon references
2. Check for any dynamically added favicon links in your JavaScript code
3. Verify that your web server is serving the files correctly

## Testing in Production

When you deploy your site, check the favicon again. Sometimes local development environments handle paths differently than production.

## For Advanced Users

If you're still having issues, you can manually create an ICO file:

1. Install ImageMagick
2. Run: `convert -background transparent src/assets/Smith-logo.png -define icon:auto-resize=16,32,48 public/favicon.ico`

This will create a proper ICO file with multiple resolutions.
